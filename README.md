# ðŸ§  AI Agent with MCP and LangChain

This project demonstrates how to create an autonomous AI agent using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [MCP (Multi-Component Protocol)](https://github.com/langchain-ai/mcp), and large language models like OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`. The agent is capable of interacting with tools such as Playwright via MCP to execute complex tasks programmatically.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Uses `LangChain` to build AI agents
- âœ… Integrates with MCP for multi-process communication and tool orchestration
- âœ… Supports Groq and OpenAI LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
- âœ… Asynchronous execution using Python's `asyncio`
- âœ… Loads configuration from `.env` and `client_config.json`

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js & npm (for Playwright MCP server)
- `.env` file with your API keys
